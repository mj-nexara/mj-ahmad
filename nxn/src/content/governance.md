\# 🏛️ Governance Principles



NXN-GENESIS operates under a transparent, contributor-driven governance model. Every decision is documented, every vote is logged, and every role is publicly defined.



\## 🧑‍⚖️ Decision Making



\- All proposals are submitted via NXN-DAO

\- Votes are logged with contributor ID and timestamp

\- Role-based permissions are enforced via backend middleware



\## 📜 Documentation Rituals



\- Every governance folder includes a README.md

\- Proposals are written in Markdown with semantic tags

\- Voting outcomes are stored in JSON format



\## 🛡️ Ethical Safeguards



\- No decision is hidden

\- Invalid or unethical proposals are flagged, not erased

\- Governance logs are immutable and inheritable



\## 🧬 Legacy Protocol



\- Departing contributors are archived with legacy.md

\- Governance history is preserved for future stewards
