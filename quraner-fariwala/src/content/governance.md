# 🏛️ Governance Principles

NXN-GENESIS operates under a transparent, contributor-driven governance model. Every decision is documented, every vote is logged, and every role is publicly defined.

## 🧑‍⚖️ Decision Making

- All proposals are submitted via NXN-DAO
- Votes are logged with contributor ID and timestamp
- Role-based permissions are enforced via backend middleware

## 📜 Documentation Rituals

- Every governance folder includes a README.md
- Proposals are written in Markdown with semantic tags
- Voting outcomes are stored in JSON format

## 🛡️ Ethical Safeguards

- No decision is hidden
- Invalid or unethical proposals are flagged, not erased
- Governance logs are immutable and inheritable

## 🧬 Legacy Protocol

- Departing contributors are archived with legacy.md
- Governance history is preserved for future stewards
